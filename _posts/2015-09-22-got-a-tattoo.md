Here's a closeup of my new tattoo! It's a blown up version of my first passport stamp, from China in 2001. That was the trip that triggered a chain of the most important events of my life.

The stamp is almost entirely from my passport, but I did change the big line of characters at the top. Originally it said "Chinese Border Police" which is weird to tattoo on oneself. Now it says, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step," but in the original Chinese from Laozi.

This is my, "Wait, I can look like it doesn't hurt!" face.
