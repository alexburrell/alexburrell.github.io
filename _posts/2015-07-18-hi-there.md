title: Hi there!

A year ago, I started a Master's program in Computational Linguistics. Doing this program part-time while working a very demanding full-time job means that I have learned enough to know that I badly want to work in this field, but I haven't built the knowledge or skills to actually get a job in this field.

My goal is to finish my Master's in the next year, and around August 2016, find a fun-challenging-exciting job in Natural Language Processing. Besides classes, I have some projects I want to work on and things I want to read/learn/try out. I'll keep all of that here, to keep track of for myself (and to focus myself), and maybe to help anyone else looking to do something similar.
